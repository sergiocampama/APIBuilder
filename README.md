# APIBuilder

Infrastructure for easily creating REST-like API services in Swift. Check
[Fintoc](https://github.com/sergiocampama/Fintoc) for an example use case.

## Acknowledgments

The API infrastructure was designed pretty much verbatim (with some _very_ minor differences) from the one in
[AvdLee/appstoreconnect-swift-sdk](https://github.com/AvdLee/appstoreconnect-swift-sdk). They do say copying is the 
sincerest form of flattery :)
